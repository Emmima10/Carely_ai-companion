Proactive schedule reminder :
 
Add a proactive “🔔 Today’s Schedule” panel to the Overview page using the personalevent table (columns: id, user_id, event_type, title, description, event_date (timestamp), recurring (0/1), importance, created_at).
Modify only:
app/database/crud.py
app/api/routes.py
frontend/dashboard.py
Reuse utils/timezone_utils.py (local day boundaries, DST-safe formatting)
1) CRUD: fetch today’s high-importance events (local day)
Create a helper in crud.py:
Name: PersonalEventCRUD.high_importance_today(user_id, local_tz="America/Chicago")
Behavior:
Compute local midnight → next midnight for today using timezone utils; convert both to UTC.
Query personalevent with:
user_id = ?
importance = 'high'
event_date between [start_utc, end_utc)
Recurring = 1 handling: treat as an event that repeats today at the same local time as the original event_date time; include it in today’s list by cloning today’s date + original local time (do not write a new row; return as a computed item).
Return items sorted by time, each with: id, title, description, event_start_utc, and a preformatted local time string (e.g., "07:30 PM CDT") generated server-side via timezone utils. Keep messages short.
2) API: endpoint for Overview polling
In routes.py add:
GET /events/high_importance_today?user_id=...
Returns JSON:
{"server_time_utc": "...","events": [{"id": 123,"title": "...","description": "...","event_start_utc": "...","event_time_local": "07:30 PM CDT","recurring": 0,"event_type": "appointment"}] } 
Time strings must come from timezone utils (no hardcoded “CST”).
3) Frontend: Overview panel with light polling
In frontend/dashboard.py (Overview tab):
Poll GET /events/high_importance_today every 15–30s without blocking the page.
Render a card “🔔 Today’s High-Importance Events”:
For each event: show event_time_local, title, short description (truncate if long).
If none: show “✅ No high-importance events left today.”
(Optional quick actions; if not implemented yet, just display the list.)
4) Constraints & hygiene
Do not change DB schema. Use the existing personalevent columns exactly as shown.
Use UTC in storage and convert to/from local using utils/timezone_utils.py.
Recurring = 1: treat as repeat today at the same local clock time inferred from event_date’s time component.
Keep API responses small; limit to today only.
5) Acceptance criteria
For importance='high' rows whose event_date falls on today (local), the Overview shows them sorted by time with correct DST-aware local times.
Rows with recurring=1 appear today at the original local time (computed), even if the stored event_date date is in the past.
When no matching events exist for today, the panel shows the green “✅” state.
No hardcoded “CST”; all times formatted via timezone utils.
